# Winehq macOS Builds

![Downloads count](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/gcenx/macOS_Wine_builds/total.svg)

<br>

#### _Please Note;_
These will function like macOS pkg releases but are packaged within a `.tar.xz`.\
I won't be providing a pkg installer, these packages include `wine` and `wine64`

<br>

#### Minimum requirement of macOS High Sierra
If you need the latest versions of wine on legacy versions of macOS use [macports-wine](https://github.com/Gcenx/macports-wine)

<br>

### How to install using brew;
First add `cask-versions`
```
brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
```

<br>

##### Available packages;
- `wine-stable`
- `wine-devel`
- `wine-staging`

<br>

##### Next select the desired wine package to be installed, for an example I'll select `wine-stable`
```
brew install --cask --no-quarantine wine-stable
```
This will install `Wine Stable` into `/Applications`

<br>

#### How manually to install;
Download the desired package from [releases](https://github.com/Gcenx/macOS_Wine_builds/releases) unpack, now move the `Wine *` bundle to `/Applications` and use as you would a Winehq release.

## gecko & mono are included;
`wine-gecko` & `wine-mono` are included within these custom `Wine-*` packages, usually wine(64) will download and install .msi packages into each and every wineprefix increasing prefix size instead the "shared" versions are used to reduce prefix size.

<br>

## Don't open wine issues here!;
Wine bugs/regressions need to be reported via [Winehq Bugzilla](https://bugs.winehq.org/)\
_Packaging related issues should be reported here._
